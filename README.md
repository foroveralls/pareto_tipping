This paper has been submitted for publication in Earth System Dynamics: Special issue on tipping points 

In this project, we conduct a literature review and intercomparison of modelling and behaviour results in order to identify general trends in social tipping dynamics on social networks.
Specifically we look at what fraction of a given social group has to engage with a specific norm in order to result in rapid, system wide norm changes.

## Datasets 
The compiled datasets to produce all figures in the manuscript are located in the `Compiled` folder.
Data used to make the main figures Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 in the manuscript are in `Tipping_threshold_plot.csv` and `Tipping_points_fin_merged_1.csv` respectively. 
Figures 4 and 5 are made with `The Pareto effect in tipping social networks Tipping Data - Tipping_Data`. Data for Table 4. are in `The Pareto effect in tipping social networks Tipping Data - Sheet_main_fig.csv`.

## Software implementation

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `Analysis`and `Figures` folders respectively.  Please email me (Jordan) if there are any questions as some scripts and data are still incomplete and some cleaning is still required
